/**
 * This file contains data specific to the "Services" section and pages.
 * It defines the structure of a service and provides an array of services
 * offered by the business, along with content for the services section itself.
 *
 * === How to Customize ===
 *
 * 1.  **Service Interface (`Service`):**
 *     -   Defines the properties for each service (id, title, description, etc.).
 *     -   `iconName`: Use the exact name of an icon from `lucide-react`
 *         (e.g., "Briefcase", "Users"). These are mapped to actual components
 *         in the `ServicesSection` component.
 *
 * 2.  **Services Array (`services`):**
 *     -   This is the core list of services your business offers.
 *     -   Add, remove, or modify service objects in this array.
 *     -   Update `title`, `shortDescription`, `description`, `iconName`,
 *         `features`, `image` path, and `price`.
 *     -   Ensure `image` paths correspond to images in the `public/images` directory.
 *
 * 3.  **Services Section Content (`servicesSectionContent`):**
 *     -   Customize the `sectionTitle`, main `title`, `subtitle`, and the
 *         text/href for the "View All Services" button.
