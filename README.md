## Configuration & Customization (Make It Yours!)

This template is designed for easy customization. Here's where to find and change key elements:

### 1. Data Management (`lib/data` directory)

All content for your website, from company details to service descriptions and testimonials, is managed in the `lib/data` directory. We've adopted a modular approach for better organization:

*   **`lib/data/index.ts`**: This file acts as the central hub, re-exporting all data from the individual files below. Components import from `@/lib/data`, which automatically pulls from here. You generally won't need to edit this file directly.
*   **`lib/data/global.ts`**: Contains site-wide configurations like `companyInfo` (name, address, social links), `siteConfig` (to enable/disable pages and sections), `headerContent`, `footerContent`, `callToActionSectionContent`, and `heroSectionContent`.
    *   **Tip**: Start here to quickly update your business's core information and control global visibility of sections.
*   **`lib/data/about.ts`**: Content for your "About Us" section and page (`aboutSectionContent`). Includes customizable image settings (`image.src`, `image.year`, `image.line1`, `image.line2`) for the visual display.
*   **`lib/data/services.ts`**: Defines your `Service` interface, the `services` array (details of each service), and `servicesSectionContent`.
*   **`lib/data/testimonials.ts`**: Defines the `Testimonial` interface, the `testimonials` array, and `testimonialsSectionContent`.
*   **`lib/data/pricing.ts`**: Defines the `PricingPlan` interface, `pricingPlans` array, `pricingPageContent`, and `individualServicesPricingContent`.
*   **`lib/data/gallery.ts`**: Defines the `GalleryItem` interface, `galleryItems` array (your project portfolio), `galleryPageContent`, and `showcaseSectionContent`.
*   **`lib/data/faq.ts`**: Defines the `FAQItem` interface, `faqData` array, and `faqPageContent`.
*   **`lib/data/contact.ts`**: Contains `contactSectionContent`, including form labels, placeholders, and the **critical `quoteEmailTemplate`**.

**How to Edit Data:**
Open the relevant `.ts` file in `lib/data`. Each file is heavily commented, guiding you on what each variable represents and how to modify it. Simply change the values of the exported constants to update your website's content.

### 2. Styling & Rebranding (`globals.css` and Tailwind CSS)

To rebrand your website, focus on `app/globals.css`:

*   **Color Palette:** The primary colors are defined as CSS variables at the top of `app/globals.css`. Look for variables like `--primary`, `--secondary`, `--accent`, etc. Adjust their HSL values to change the overall color scheme of your site. Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `text-primary`, `bg-accent`) will automatically pick up these changes.
*   **Fonts:** You can easily change the fonts by updating the `font-sans` and `font-heading` variables, which use Google Fonts by default.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For more granular styling, use [Tailwind CSS utility classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) directly in your components. This allows for rapid and consistent styling without writing custom CSS.

### 3. SEO Optimization (`app/layout.tsx` and Metadata)

Next.js App Router provides powerful built-in SEO features.
Edit `app/layout.tsx` to customize your site's metadata:

*   **`metadata` object**: This is where you define your site's `title`, `description`, `keywords`, and `authors`.
*   **Open Graph Image (`og:image`)**: Essential for social media sharing. Update the `url` property within `metadata.openGraph.images` to point to your branding image.
    *   **Recommended Dimensions**: For optimal display across platforms, your Open Graph image should be a landscape image with an aspect ratio of 1.91:1 (e.g., `1200x630` pixels).
*   **Favicon**: Replace `app/favicon.ico` with your company's favicon. Ensure it's a `.ico` file for broad browser compatibility.
*   **Robots.txt & Sitemap**: Ensure `app/robots.txt` and `app/sitemap.ts` are configured correctly to guide search engine crawlers.

### 4. Images & Media (`public` directory)

All static images are stored in the `public` directory. Replace the placeholder files with your own branded assets.

#### Site-Wide Images

The template includes SVG placeholder images. Replace these with your own branded assets (PNG, JPG, or WebP recommended for photos).

| Placeholder | Replace With | Recommended Size | Description |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `app/favicon.ico` | Your favicon | 32x32 or 48x48 | Browser tab icon. Use `.ico` format for compatibility. |
| `public/og-image.svg` | `og-image.png` | 1200x630 | Social media preview image (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter). |
| `public/about-image.svg` | `about-image.png` | 800x800 (1:1) | About section image. Set path in `lib/data/about.ts` (`image.src`). Set to `null` for animated visual. |
| `public/map-preview.svg` | `map-preview.png` | 640x360 (16:9) | Header location dropdown - Google Maps screenshot of your business location. |
| `public/service-area.svg` | `service-area.png` | 640x360 (16:9) | Contact section - Google Maps screenshot of your service coverage area. |

**Note:** After replacing SVG placeholders with PNG/JPG files, update the file references in:
-   `lib/data/about.ts` (about-image via `image.src`)
-   `components/header.tsx` (map-preview)
-   `components/sections/contact.tsx` (service-area)

#### Gallery Images

Gallery images are stored in `public/gallery/` and referenced in `lib/data/gallery.ts`. The template includes 12 SVG placeholder images (`project-1.svg` through `project-12.svg`).

| Placeholder Pattern | Replace With | Recommended Size | Aspect Ratio | Description |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `project-1.svg` through `project-12.svg` | `project-1.jpg` etc. | 800x600 or larger | 4:3 | Project/portfolio images for gallery and showcase. |

**To add gallery images:**
1.  Place your images in the `public/gallery/` directory (PNG, JPG, or WebP)
2.  Update the `galleryItems` array in `lib/data/gallery.ts` with:
    -   `image`: Path to the image (e.g., `"/gallery/my-project.jpg"`)
    -   `title`: Project title
    -   `category`: Category for filtering (e.g., `"Residential"`, `"Commercial"`)
    -   `description`: Brief description

**Example:**
```typescript
// lib/data/gallery.ts
export const galleryItems: GalleryItem[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Kitchen Renovation",
    category: "Residential",
    image: "/gallery/kitchen-renovation.jpg",
    description: "Complete kitchen remodel with modern fixtures"
  },
  // ... more items
]
```

#### How to Create Map Images

1.  Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
2.  Search for your business address (for `map-preview.png`) or zoom out to show your service area (for `service-area.png`)
3.  Take a screenshot at the recommended aspect ratio (16:9)
4.  Save as PNG in the `public` directory

#### Image Optimization

All images in `public` are automatically optimized by Next.js when using the `next/image` component. For best performance:
-   Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, or WebP for best compression
-   Keep file sizes under 500KB where possible
-   Gallery images: 800x600 minimum, larger images will be automatically resized
-   Ensure images match the recommended aspect ratios

### 5. Icons (`lucide-react`)

We use [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for customizable SVG icons.

*   **Using Existing Icons:** In data files (e.g., `lib/data/services.ts`), you'll see `iconName` properties. Set these to the exact name of any Lucide icon (e.g., `"Briefcase"`, `"Users"`, `"Lightbulb"`). The components dynamically render the correct icon.
*   **Finding More Icons:** Browse the full library of icons on the [Lucide website](https://lucide.dev/icons/).
*   **Adding New Icons:** If a specific icon isn't imported in a component that needs it, you'll need to add it to the import statement of that component (e.g., `import { NewIconName } from "lucide-react"`).

### 6. Contact Form & Email Template

The contact form uses the [Resend API](https://resend.com/) to send emails.

*   **API Key**: Ensure your `RESEND_API_KEY` is correctly set in your `.env.local` file (and on your hosting provider).
*   **Email Template**: The HTML structure of the email sent upon form submission is defined in `lib/data/contact.ts` within the `quoteEmailTemplate` string. Customize this to match your branding and include all necessary information.
    *   **Important**: Placeholders like `{{firstName}}`, `{{email}}`, etc., are used to dynamically insert form data. If you change your form fields, ensure these placeholders are updated accordingly in the template.

## Extending Functionality

### Add New UI Components with `shadcn/ui`

`shadcn/ui` makes it incredibly easy to add new, accessible, and customizable UI components.

1.  **Browse Components:** Visit the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) to explore available components (e.g., `Accordion`, `Carousel`, `Data Table`, `Calendar`).
2.  **Install a Component:** To add a new component, for example, a `Calendar`, run:
    ```bash
    pnpm shadcn-ui add calendar
    ```
    This command will add the component's code to your `components/ui` directory, allowing you to fully customize it.
3.  **Integrate:** Import the component into your desired React component and use it as needed. This approach provides maximum flexibility and ownership over your UI.

## Next Steps for Your Business (Post-Deployment Checklist)

Once your website is live, consider these crucial steps:

1.  **Verify SEO Setup**: Use Google Search Console to submit your sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`) and monitor your site's performance in search results. Address any crawling or indexing issues.
2.  **Google Business Profile**: Register and verify your business with [Google Business Profile](https://www.google.com/business/). This is essential for local SEO and appearing in Google Maps.
3.  **Google Analytics**: Implement Google Analytics (or another analytics tool) to track website traffic, user behavior, and conversion rates.
4.  **Social Media Integration**: Ensure all social media links in your `lib/data/global.ts` are active and point to your official profiles.
5.  **Legal Pages**: Double-check your Privacy Policy and Terms of Service (`app/privacy-policy/page.tsx`, `app/terms-of-service/page.tsx`) to ensure they comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
6.  **Regular Content Updates**: Keep your website content fresh and relevant. Regularly update service descriptions, gallery items, testimonials, and FAQ answers in the `lib/data` directory.
7.  **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor your website's performance using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or Vercel Analytics to ensure a fast and smooth user experience.
