## Configuration & Customization (Make It Yours!)

This template is designed for easy customization. Here's where to find and change key elements:

### 1. Data Management (`lib/data` directory)

All content for Cale's Lawncare's website, from company details to service descriptions and gallery items, is managed in the `lib/data` directory. We've adopted a modular approach for better organization:

*   **`lib/data/index.ts`**: This file acts as the central hub, re-exporting all data from the individual files below. Components import from `@/lib/data`, which automatically pulls from here. You generally won't need to edit this file directly.
*   **`lib/data/global.ts`**: Contains site-wide configurations like `companyInfo` (name, address, contact), `siteConfig` (to enable/disable pages and sections, including individual social media toggles), `headerContent`, `footerContent`, `callToActionSectionContent`, and `heroSectionContent`.
    *   **Tip**: Start here to quickly update Cale's Lawncare's core information and control global visibility of sections and social media links.
*   **`lib/data/about.ts`**: Content for the "About Us" section and page (`aboutSectionContent`). Includes customizable image settings (`image.src`, `image.year`, `image.line1`, `image.line2`) for the visual display.
*   **`lib/data/services.ts`**: Defines your `Service` interface, the `services` array (details of each lawn care service), and `servicesSectionContent`.
*   **`lib/data/testimonials.ts`**: Defines the `Testimonial` interface, the `testimonials` array, and `testimonialsSectionContent`. Note: This section is currently disabled as per client request.
*   **`lib/data/pricing.ts`**: Defines the `PricingPlan` interface, `pricingPlans` array, `pricingPageContent`, and `individualServicesPricingContent`.
*   **`lib/data/gallery.ts`**: Defines the `GalleryItem` interface, `galleryItems` array (Cale's Lawncare's project portfolio), `galleryPageContent`, and `showcaseSectionContent`.
*   **`lib/data/faq.ts`**: Defines the `FAQItem` interface, `faqData` array, and `faqPageContent`.
*   **`lib/data/contact.ts`**: Contains `contactSectionContent`, including form labels, placeholders, and the **critical `quoteEmailTemplate`**.

**How to Edit Data:**
Open the relevant `.ts` file in `lib/data`. Each file is heavily commented, guiding you on what each variable represents and how to modify it. Simply change the values of the exported constants to update Cale's Lawncare's website content.

### 2. Styling & Rebranding (`globals.css` and Tailwind CSS)

To rebrand Cale's Lawncare's website, focus on `app/globals.css`:

*   **Color Palette:** The primary colors are defined as CSS variables at the top of `app/globals.css`. Look for variables like `--primary`, `--secondary`, `--accent`, etc. Adjust their HSL values to change the overall color scheme of your site. Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `text-primary`, `bg-accent`) will automatically pick up these changes.
*   **Fonts:** You can easily change the fonts by updating the `font-sans` and `font-heading` variables, which use Google Fonts by default.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For more granular styling, use [Tailwind CSS utility classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) directly in your components. This allows for rapid and consistent styling without writing custom CSS.

### 3. SEO Optimization (`app/layout.tsx` and Metadata)

Next.js App Router provides powerful built-in SEO features.
Edit `app/layout.tsx` to customize your site's metadata:

*   **`metadata` object**: This is where you define your site's `title`, `description`, `keywords`, and `authors`.
*   **Open Graph Image (`og:image`)**: Essential for social media sharing. Update the `url` property within `metadata.openGraph.images` to point to your branding image.
    *   **Recommended Dimensions**: For optimal display across platforms, your Open Graph image should be a landscape image with an aspect ratio of 1.91:1 (e.g., `1200x630` pixels).
*   **Favicon**: Replace `app/favicon.ico` with your company's favicon. Ensure it's a `.ico` file for broad browser compatibility.
*   **Robots.txt & Sitemap**: Ensure `app/robots.txt` and `app/sitemap.ts` are configured correctly to guide search engine crawlers.

### 4. Images & Media (`public` directory)

All static images are stored in the `public` directory. Replace the placeholder files with Cale's Lawncare's own branded assets.

#### Site-Wide Images

The template includes SVG placeholder images. Replace these with Cale's Lawncare's own branded assets (PNG, JPG, or WebP recommended for photos).

| Placeholder | Replace With | Recommended Size | Description |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `app/favicon.ico` | Your favicon | 32x32 or 48x48 | Browser tab icon. Use `.ico` format for compatibility. |
| `public/og-image.svg` | `og-image.png` | 1200x630 | Social media preview image (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter). |
| `public/about-image.svg` | `about-image.png` | 800x800 (1:1) | About section image. Set path in `lib/data/about.ts` (`image.src`). Set to `null` for animated visual. |
| `public/map-preview.svg` | `map-preview.png` | 640x360 (16:9) | Header location dropdown - Google Maps screenshot of Cale's Lawncare's business location. |
| `public/service-area.svg` | `service-area.png` | 640x360 (16:9) | Contact section - Google Maps screenshot of Cale's Lawncare's service coverage area. |

**Note:** After replacing SVG placeholders with PNG/JPG files, update the file references in:
-   `lib/data/about.ts` (about-image via `image.src`)
-   `components/header.tsx` (map-preview)
-   `components/sections/contact.tsx` (service-area)

#### Gallery Images

Gallery images are stored in `public/gallery/` and referenced in `lib/data/gallery.ts`.

| Placeholder Pattern | Replace With | Recommended Size | Aspect Ratio | Description |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `project-1.svg` through `project-12.svg` | `project-1.jpg` etc. | 800x600 or larger | 4:3 | Cale's Lawncare project/portfolio images for gallery and showcase. |

**To add gallery images:**
1.  Place your images in the `public/gallery/` directory (PNG, JPG, or WebP)
2.  Update the `galleryItems` array in `lib/data/gallery.ts` with:
    -   `image`: Path to the image (e.g., `"/gallery/my-project.jpg"`)
    -   `title`: Project title
    -   `category`: Category for filtering (e.g., `"Residential"`, `"Commercial"`)
    -   `description`: Brief description

**Example:**
```typescript
// lib/data/gallery.ts
export const galleryItems: GalleryItem[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Kitchen Renovation",
    category: "Residential",
    image: "/gallery/kitchen-renovation.jpg",
    description: "Complete kitchen remodel with modern fixtures"
  },
  // ... more items
]
```

#### How to Create Map Images

1.  Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
2.  Search for Cale's Lawncare's business address (for `map-preview.png`) or zoom out to show the service area (for `service-area.png`)
3.  Take a screenshot at the recommended aspect ratio (16:9)
4.  Save as PNG in the `public` directory

#### Image Optimization

All images in `public` are automatically optimized by Next.js when using the `next/image` component. For best performance:
-   Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, or WebP for best compression
-   Keep file sizes under 500KB where possible
-   Gallery images: 800x600 minimum, larger images will be automatically resized
-   Ensure images match the recommended aspect ratios

### 5. Icons (`lucide-react` via `lib/icon-map.ts`)

We use [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for customizable SVG icons. Due to Next.js tree-shaking, icons are managed through a centralized icon map.

*   **Using Icons:** In data files (e.g., `lib/data/services.ts`), set the `iconName` property to match an icon name in the icon map (e.g., `"Briefcase"`, `"Users"`, `"Lightbulb"`).
*   **Finding More Icons:** Browse the full library on the [Lucide website](https://lucide.dev/icons/).
*   **Adding New Icons:** To use an icon not already in the map:
    1.  Open `lib/icon-map.ts`
    2.  Find the icon in the commented list (organized by category) or add a new import
    3.  Uncomment the icon in BOTH the `import` statement AND the `iconMap` object
    4.  Use the icon name in your data files

**Example:** To add the `Coffee` icon:
```typescript
// In lib/icon-map.ts

import {
  // ... existing imports ...
  Coffee,  // Uncomment this
  // ...
} from "lucide-react"

const iconMap: Record<string, LucideIcon> = {
  // ... existing icons ...
  Coffee,  // Uncomment this
  // ...
}
```

Then use it in your data:
```typescript
// In lib/data/services.ts
{
  iconName: "Coffee",  // Now available
  // ...
}
```

**Performance Note:** Only uncomment icons you actually use. Each icon adds ~1-2KB to the bundle.

### 6. Contact Form & Email Template

The contact form uses the [Resend API](https://resend.com/) to send emails.

*   **API Key**: Ensure your `RESEND_API_KEY` is correctly set in your `.env.local` file (and on your hosting provider).
*   **Email Template**: The HTML structure of the email sent upon form submission is defined in `lib/data/contact.ts` within the `quoteEmailTemplate` string. Customize this to match your branding and include all necessary information.
    *   **Important**: Placeholders like `{{firstName}}`, `{{email}}`, etc., are used to dynamically insert form data. If you change your form fields, ensure these placeholders are updated accordingly in the template.

## Extending Functionality

### Add New UI Components with `shadcn/ui`

`shadcn/ui` makes it incredibly easy to add new, accessible, and customizable UI components.

1.  **Browse Components:** Visit the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) to explore available components (e.g., `Accordion`, `Carousel`, `Data Table`, `Calendar`).
2.  **Install a Component:** To add a new component, for example, a `Calendar`, run:
    ```bash
    pnpm shadcn-ui add calendar
    ```
    This command will add the component's code to your `components/ui` directory, allowing you to fully customize it.
3.  **Integrate:** Import the component into your desired React component and use it as needed. This approach provides maximum flexibility and ownership over your UI.
